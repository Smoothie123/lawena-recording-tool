Records using ingame Source Recorder, with key bindings to ease the process.\r\n\r\nEasy-to-use and no install required. This tool does not interfere with your regular TF2 configuration, HUD or launch options. Requires [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/) in order to run.\r\n\r\n![Main Window Preview](http://i.imgur.com/kXHsYDu.png)\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* Insane max quality graphics configuration. \r\n* Recorded files are saved to the directory of your choosing for comfort and order.\r\n* Options to enable/disable various game elements which may be unnecessary in the context of a movie.\r\n* Includes built-in moviehuds with different levels of simplicity.\r\n* Supports custom HUDs/materials/models/etc to add a personal touch to your movies.\r\n* Includes a set of built-in skyboxes, and supports custom skyboxes via simple drag-and-drop.\r\n* [SrcDemo2](https://code.google.com/p/srcdemo2/) support to reduce drive usage and space.\r\n* [VDM](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Demo_Recording_Tools) file support for automatizing your movie recording process.\r\n* Updates automatically, you can see the latest changes [here](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/commits/v4.1.x).\r\n\r\n# Installing Lawena\r\nIf you want to use a stable version, check the [releases](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/releases) page. Simply download the zip release, extract it anywhere and run ``lawena.exe``.\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n\r\n* If you have your own class configs with ``bind`` command in them, you can lose some of the lawena's own keybindings, because class configs get recorded into the ``.dem`` files. Just check out ``recbindings.cfg`` and execute the equivalent console command.\r\n* Selecting your own custom/mystuff/cfg files to load into TF2 can cause loss of recording quality and lawena's keybindings.\r\n* Some keybindings might be missing, an alternative is to type ``startrecording`` into the console, otherwise check out you're not playing a demo that rebinds some keys and if it does, edit ``recbindings.cfg`` inside lawena ``cfg`` folder accordingly to solve it.\r\n* Custom HUDs can trigger a \"Failed to restore files\" due to Windows locking a custom font file. In case your custom files somehow get misplaced and disappear upon restoring, there are backup archives of your custom files in your ``tf`` folder named lawena-user._timestamp_.bak.zip.\r\n* Choosing a movie/recording folder with special characters like brackets or accents might confuse Source Recorder and not save any frames. Use simpler path names.\r\n\r\n# Latest development builds\r\nThere's some pre-releases that preview upcoming content. To download the latest, not particularly stable version:\r\n\r\n* [Download this repository](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/archive/v4.x.zip) and extract it to any folder.\r\n* Run **gradlew.bat** (Windows) or **gradlew** script (Unix) to start the program. Administrative permissions are required due to the use of symbolic links.\r\n\r\nYou can also switch updater branches from within the tool, just go to the `Help -> Switch Updater Branch...` menu item, choose one of the branches, press OK and restart the tool to apply the changes. The current branches are:\r\n\r\n* ``release-v4.1`` &mdash; latest stable version (Recommended)\r\n* ``preview-v4.1`` &mdash; latest updates being tested\r\n* ``release-v4.2``/``snapshot-v4.2`` &mdash; newer version featuring symbolic links, multiple Source game support and other features. (Unstable!)\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n* Original project by Montz (currently inactive)\r\n* Current developer: Quantic ([steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepropane)) since June 2013\r\n* Graphical ``.cfg`` files based on those made by [Chris' maxquality](https://chrisdown.name/tf2/)\r\n* Built-in Killnotices and Medic HUD made by [mih](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023136325) [[repo](https://github.com/Kuw/recordinghuds)]\r\n* Skyboxes included made by komaokc from GameBanana\r\n* Includes some content used in PLDX recording tool\r\n* Valve - Team Fortress and Team Fortress logo\r\n\r\n# Questions?\r\nIn case of issues, questions or feature requests you should [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/issues) or ask me via [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).
