=====================

Simple Java program that greatly enhances your TF2 and other Source games image quality for recording purposes, with little performance loss compared to other alternatives. Records using in-game **Source Recorder**, with key bindings to ease the process.

Easy to install and use. Does not interfere with your regular configs, HUD or launch options.
